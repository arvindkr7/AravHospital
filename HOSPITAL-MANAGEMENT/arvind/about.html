		<b>Our Journey</b>
<p>
Brand Arav was established in 2000 with the vision, <i>'to create a world class integrated healthcare delivery system in India, entailing the finest medical skills combined with compassionate patient care.'</i></p>
<p>
Arav Healthcare is the country’s ‘fastest’ growing healthcare group. We have grown from first hospital at Jalandhar (Punjab) which opened in 2018. This include the world famous Escorts Heart Institute and the erstwhile Wockhardt facilities. From North to South, East to West, Arav truly has India covered - the frontier city of Amritsar, to Ludhiana is the home to Arav facilities.
Arav occupies a place of pride in India’s healthcare delivery system.</p>

<b><u>Our Brand and the Logo</u></b>

<p>The Arav brand with its distinctive logo is a synthesis of human values of trust, ethics and service and quality healthcare. We project clinical excellence, distinctive patient care, transparency in actions & high level of integrity and excellence is all that we do.</p>
<p>
Our logo projects these very values. The integration of the hands (in a distinctive ‘green’ with a ‘red dot’) and the human figure is completely seamless and is representative of ‘Arav’ responsive approach to healthcare. The green colour of hands is representative of health, wellbeing, compassion, nurturing and generosity while the red dot gives an immediate association to our Indian roots, while it is also represents energy, spirituality, courage and symbol of good luck.
</p>
<p>
At Arav we intrinsically believe that excellence is a not a destination – but a journey.</p>
